It is a convention in the Moodle code that all CLI scripts are put into the cli/ folder inside the plugin directory.
Make sure all these files declare themselves as CLI scripts properly (the constant must be defined prior to loading
the config.php):

define('CLI_SCRIPT', true);
require(__DIR__.'/../../../config.php');
require_once($CFG->libdir.'/clilib.php');
